# Practice_Project
Coding Challenge 


Technologies: React, Node.js, Webpack, Babel



Getting Started

  1) Enter "npm install" in the terminal from the root directory(pub_coding_challenge) to install depenencies


  2) Enter "npm run react-dev" in the terminal from the root directory(pub_coding_challenge) to compile es6/jsx with webpack and babel

  3) Enter "npm run server-start" to start the server


  4) Open browser(only tested on chrome) to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ to see running app.  **Need to add your own API_Key in place of the variable Unique_JWT in /server/index.js""


  Next steps

    Unfortunately I didn't have time to do everything I wanted to do. Next steps would be: 

      1) Format dates and allow to sort by recent articles
      2) Sort by score to show the most popular stores first
      3) styling (I did none ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
      4) Add tests (specifically to test the API calls and rendering of components)
      5) Add proptypes
      6) format authors for multiple or zero authors
      7) Add location to add your own api key (I used .gitignore to hide my key)
